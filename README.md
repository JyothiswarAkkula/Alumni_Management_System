# 2.1 EXISTING SYSTEM
In the Existing System all old students record work done on the paper. The whole year old
students record is stored in the registers. We can’t generate reports as per our requirements
because its take more time to calculate the report.
# 2.1.1 DEMERITS
• Not user friendly: The present system not user friendly because data is not stored in
structure and proper format and it takes lots of time consuming.
• Manual Control: All report calculation is done manually so there is a chance of error.
• Lots of paper work: Old students record maintain in the register so lots of paper require
storing details.
# 2.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system is a computerized system but which is maintained at centralized
databases i.e. in automated forms it’s a very fast process. And maintaining all the records in
online systems database which makes it very easy to access and retrieve data from the database.
If they want any record they can easily search all the records.
# 2.2.1 MERITS
